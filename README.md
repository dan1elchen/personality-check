# Personality-check

This project was created for HackMIT.

We performed sentimental analysis on Reddit posts and in particular, shows the moods of the post in terms of percentage positive, neutral, and negative.

Our original goal was to use machine learning to create our own model to read social media posts and return an MBTI personality to those posts. However, we decided to do something smaller scale with our limited time constraints.
